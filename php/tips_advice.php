<p> Do you feel that you could have got a better deal on your last new mobile purchase? Or are you buying a new mobile and are afraid of being taken for a call by the dealer? Worry not - MobileMuse’s new mobile discount negotiation guide helps you make maximum out of your new mobile deal.
It may be surprising for most of us but the reality is that there are at least three types of discounts one can ask or bargain for from a new mobile dealer! New mobile buying is a process in itself and consists of several individual small deals. They might look insignificant at first glance but when you add them up, the entire amount of the discount is more than 10% of the overall price. Of course all of these discounts majorly depend on the make of the mobiles and their demand in the market.
